package com.drelang.algorithms.p10_regularExpressionMatch;

/**
 * Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
 *
 * '.' Matches any single character.
 * '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
 * The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.
 * p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like . or *.
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 * s = "aa"
 * p = "a"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input:
 * s = "aa"
 * p = "a*"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the precedeng element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
